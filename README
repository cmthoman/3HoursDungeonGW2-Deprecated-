This project was at one point a friend of mine's vision to build a gaming community. I developed the following project as a learning experience in cakephp. The outcome is essentially a forum and basic user management system in cakephp running on MYSQL and Apache on Debian Linux.

This project is still hosted at gw2.3hoursdungeon.com

3 Hours Dungeon is a chain of interconnected websites built to support a large gaming community. Our goal is to provide members with content for all the games we support. Each game resides on a "portal" and each portal has a list of user user roles, profiles and game features, but is connected through a universal log-in system.

Every "Portal" is based off of our "Base" project hub which contains the core elements for each 3 Hours Dungeon "Portal". From the base, specific features emerge for each portal such as extensive profile customization and unqiue features for the game being viewed.

The entire project is based on CakePHP. Configuration is simple and should already be contained within these files. Installation only requires a webserver running PHP 5.2 or higher and MySQL 5.x or higher. Simply drop the project into your webserver and configure your database to begin.

Setting up your database:

The website log-in system requires that you have the database named "3hd_shared" created. Simply import "clean_3hd_shared.sql" into this database to begin. Each "portal" has a "content" database named <abbreviated game name>_content. This is the Guild Wars 2 portal, the content database is named "gw2_content". Simply import "clean_gw2_content.sql" into your database to begin.

Connecting the project to your database:

To connect to the databse you will need to locate the database.php file in "projectroot/app/config". At the bottom you will see two configurations, one for the shared database and one for the content database. Change the username, password and host to match your MySQL server setup.

Congrats, you should be connected and ready to begin! If you have any questions please contact me via github or email @ epimyth@gmail.com
